# WonderCity
#### V1.0.0
## Description
WonderCity is the new undercity utilizing a newer (and possibly more efficient) explorer (batmobile).
Fully integrated and requires Alfred the butler, Batmobile and Looter.

WARNING: the only build that I have reliably able to complete Mythic tributes is crackling sorc with both tele enchant and teleport enabled on batmobile.
